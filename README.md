# Java-Asteroids-Uni-Project
The purpose of this assignment was to develop a clone of the classic game Asteroids using Java.

## Infrastructure 
### Graphics
This is being done with Java Swing, when I developed this I didn't know how to load in images to use in the game so I used what I already knew and implemented it with Swing.
